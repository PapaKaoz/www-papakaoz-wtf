Let’s get this journey started! To be honest, I think the journey started earlier. Some years ago I decided to make a smaller
modification of the direction of my career, and started a series of blog post named
[“I want to be a penetration tester when I grow up”](https://medium.com/@hkanfahlstedt). Either I didn’t grow up or I just didn’t
finish what I started, because I’m still not a penetration tester.

Now I’ve decided to adjust my goal a bit, instead of penetration testing, my aim is for bug bounty hunting. Not that much of a
difference, but I guess after some rejections when trying to enter the field of cyber security via my career I’ll do this on
the side instead.

The idea is that I will share my experiences trying to become successful in the field of bug bounty hunting.

I thought I start with giving a bit of background of what I’ve been doing so far. Mainly so anybody that follows along knows what
kind of knowledge I had to begin with. I know some successful bounty hunters doesn’t have a background in IT at all, and
apparently that works out well for some. I have a pretty solid IT background, I started with a master in information security
(I guess you can say my journey even started then), but when I started my career I chose software development as my source of
income. That has been almost the same for more than twenty years now. I have always kept contact with the security field, wether
it’s been in form of studying cryptography or trying out CTFs. Whenever there has been a possibility to apply some sort of security
knowledge in my project I’ve used that to learn more. When it comes to programming language my journey have been something like
this (Only professional experience listed):

**C &rarr; C++ &rarr; C# &rarr; Erlang &rarr; JavsaScript &rarr; Python. **

I’d say I have the most experience with JavaScript and C#, but currently I’m using JavaScript and Python in my work. My goals here
is to get a lot better with Python and also learn Go.

When it comes to Cyber Security, I've been doing CTFs from time to time, and I've always kept an eye on what is happening in the
industry, but I've never been professionally active in this field.

Personal information at last, I'm from Sweden and I'm almost ancient when it comes to age, I'm turning 48 in 2022. I have a bunch of
kids and a wife. We also have two cats.

That was a bit long and maybe irrelevant intro, but with that out of the way I will be focusing on content about Bug Bounty in the
future.
