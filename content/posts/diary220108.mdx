I will try to keep some kind of semi-daily diary where I share my thoughts, struggles and learnings.

Up to now, most of what I've been doing is setting things up like domain, email, Twitter-account, this web page etc. I've also started regestering at
Bug Bounty programs. Up to now I've created accounts at [Hacker One](https://www.hackerone.com), [BugCrowd](https://www.bugcrowd.com) and
[Intigriti](https://www.intigriti.com). That's basically it, I'm not at all sure how to take the next step. My plan is to learn some of the recon tools
that are available, and then find a target for my first session of Bug Bounty hunting.
