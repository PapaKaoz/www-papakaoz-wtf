I will try to keep some kind of semi-daily diary where I share my thoughts, struggles and learnings.

Up to now, most of what I've been doing is setting things up like domain, email, Twitter-account, this web page etc. I've also started regestering at
Bug Bounty programs. Up to now I've created accounts at [Hacker One](https://www.hackerone.com), [BugCrowd](https://www.bugcrowd.com) and
[Intigriti](https://www.intigriti.com). That's basically it, I'm not at all sure how to take the next step. My plan is to learn some of the recon tools
that are available, and then find a target for my first session of Bug Bounty hunting.

_Update:_ I've submitted a identity confirmation at Intigiriti. This is needed to be elgible for some of the Bug Bounty programs.

_Update 2:_ I got approved too :-)

_Update 3:_ Started looking at som Bug Bounty programs, but the feeling is that I have no idea how to start. I think I need to educate myself a bit more. But
in the same time I fear getting stuck in learning mode, and not just doing. Learning mode is so cozy ;-)
